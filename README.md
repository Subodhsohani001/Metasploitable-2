## Penetration Test: Metasploitable 2 (Educational Lab) ‚Äî Oct 3, 2025 ‚ö°

### TL;DR
Completed an end-to-end lab penetration test against Metasploitable 2. Enumerated services, found multiple vulnerable services, and exploited the **vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor** to obtain a root shell. Documented findings, impact, and practical remediation steps.

---

### Objectives üéØ
- Practice the full pentest lifecycle: discovery ‚Üí vulnerability identification ‚Üí exploit ‚Üí post-exploitation verification ‚Üí remediation recommendations.  
- Produce clear, reproducible documentation suitable for learning and defensive hardening.

---

### Environment üß™
- **Target:** Metasploitable 2 VM 
- **Attacker:** Kali Linux VM  
- **Scope:** Isolated lab environment (permissioned)

---

### Tools & Techniques üõ†Ô∏è
- **Nmap** ‚Äî network discovery, full TCP scan, version detection  
- **Metasploit Framework** ‚Äî `exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor`  
- Manual post-exploitation checks: `whoami`, `ifconfig`, `ls`

---

### Key Findings ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Critical:** vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor ‚Äî remote code execution leading to a root shell (confirmed via Metasploit).  
- Several other exposed services (ssh, telnet, mysql, http, vnc) present for additional enumeration and learning.

### Steps I performed üß≠
1. Performed subnet discovery and identified the Metasploitable host.  
2. Ran full TCP port scan and targeted version detection (`nmap -p-` + `-sV`).  
3. Identified vsftpd 2.3.4 and confirmed public advisory for a backdoor.  
4. Launched Metasploit module `exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor`, set `RHOSTS`, and executed.  
5. Verified compromise (`whoami` ‚Üí `root`, `ifconfig`) and captured session output.  
6. Documented findings, impact, and remediation guidance in the final report. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### Impact üí•
- Full system compromise is achievable on an unpatched host ‚Äî highlights the importance of timely patching, minimizing exposed services, and adopting secure alternatives (SFTP/FTPS).

---

### Recommendations ‚úÖ
- Remove or upgrade vulnerable vsftpd builds; use SFTP (OpenSSH) or properly configured FTPS instead.  
- Apply network segmentation and host-based monitoring.  
- Rebuild compromised hosts from trusted images and rotate all credentials.  
- Implement regular vulnerability scanning and automated patching where feasible.

### Artifacts included üìÅ
- `pentest_report_metasploitable2_v1.0_20251003.pdf` ‚Äî full written report with command outputs and screenshots. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- (Suggested) `evidence/` ‚Äî redacted screenshots (`01-nmap.png`, `02-msf-run.png`, `03-whoami.png`)  
- (Suggested) `notes/commands.txt` ‚Äî reproduction commands for lab environments

> Tip: keep raw logs and any sensitive artifacts out of the public repo. Add them to `.gitignore` if you keep them locally.

---

### Skills demonstrated üß†
- Vulnerability discovery & validation  
- Exploit execution (Metasploit)  
- Post-exploitation verification and impact analysis  
- Technical reporting & remediation guidance

---

### Next steps ‚ûï
- Build a hardened remediation playbook (Ansible/CIS benchmarks).  
- Create an automated verification script to detect vsftpd and similar risky versions.  
- Develop a simple dashboard to visualize scan/exploit timelines and evidence.
